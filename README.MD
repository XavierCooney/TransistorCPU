# Xavier's Discrete Transistor CPU

I'm trying to build a thing this summer. Right now a lot of it is in my head, some of it is in code, and some of it is built. There's still a lot to go. For some of my ideas about the architecture, see [the plan document](PLAN.MD).

For all the code related to specifying and simulating the circuits see the [circuit folder](https://github.com/XavierCooney/TransistorCPU/tree/main/circuit).

TODO: document more of this.
